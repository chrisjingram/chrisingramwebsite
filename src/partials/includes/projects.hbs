        <h2>Active 10</h2>
        <p>I lead the development of the iOS and server architecture for Public Health England's app <strong>One You Active 10</strong>. The app interacts with activity, location and pedometer sensors in the iPhone to calculate the speed at which the user walks, providing them with rewards and achievements to encourage them to walk faster and become more healthy. All calculations are performed on the phone, and algorithms were designed with performance and battery life in mind. Data is sent periodically to a server architecture designed with the appropriate scalability and security to support half a million users' sensitive data.</p>

        <h2>MoveMore</h2>
        <p>I am the sole iOS developer for the mobile app supporting the MoveMore campaign in Sheffield, providing scores, a breakdown of the users daily activity, and competitions. From concept to production I designed and developed the backend motion tracking technology, front end interface and scalable server architecture to capture large quantities of data from users of the app.</p>

        <h2>Seeing With My Own Eyes</h2>
        <p>As a project for OAK Research Group, I developed a web app to enable visually impaired students to fully engage with the live demonstrations that take place in the modern classroom. Using WebRTC technology the teacher's screen can be live streamed to the student's laptop with just one click, and without third party software.</p>
